# GeoPackageManagerJava
This is a GeoPackage Manager That uses the GeoPackage Java Libraries

## What is in Here? ##
This is basically a simple repo that contains code for easier DAO creation and manipulation. It will also include code to make new Geopackages and alter existing ones. 

It uses a command line interface, but the data structures allow it to be easily implementable in a GUI as well.
